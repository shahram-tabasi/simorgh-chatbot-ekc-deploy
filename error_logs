cocoindex     | To get started you may need to restart your current shell.
cocoindex     | This would reload your PATH environment variable to include
cocoindex     | Cargo's bin directory ($HOME/.cargo/bin).
cocoindex     | 
cocoindex     | To configure your current shell, you need to source
cocoindex     | the corresponding env file under $HOME/.cargo.
